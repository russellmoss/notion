**American Wineries Need to GTM or GTFO**

The wine industry is having its Blockbuster moment, and most of you don't even see it coming.

I just spent three years transforming a Hudson Valley winery from a rural bar to a revenue engine. We 50X'd our wine club membership. 4X'd total revenue. 50X'd e-commerce. And you know what the most common reaction was from other winery owners?

"That's nice, Russell, but we're about the *romance* of wine."

Cool. Romance doesn't pay your harvest crew.

Here's the uncomfortable math: Boomers are aging out. Hard. The demographic cliff hits peak velocity between 2028-2031. Gen Z drinks 70% less wine than their parents. Your East Coast tasting room is converting at 3% to wine club because you're running it like a gastropub. Your West Coast operation might hit 6%, and you think you're crushing it. Meanwhile, both coasts are celebrating 50% bottle conversion like it's an achievement, when half your visitors walking out empty-handed should be a crisis, not a KPI.

Kaan Kurtural warned us years ago: "When California gets a cold, the rest of the wine industry gets the flu." Well, California isn't sniffling anymore—it's on a ventilator. 100,000 tons of grapes rotted on the vine in 2024. For the second year straight. They're pulling 35,000-40,000 acres annually.

Yet Oregon's acreage remains "in balance with demand." Why? Because they never chased volume. They stayed small, stayed premium, stayed direct.

The lesson? Get smarter at smaller scales or get buried at larger ones.

### **Problem #1: You're Still Chasing Grocery Stores and Sommeliers (While Wholesalers Rob You Blind)**

Taylor Harrison just dropped a truth bomb on LinkedIn that should make every winery owner rage-quit their distributor contracts. Since 2020, rising shelf prices haven't been helping wineries—they've been filling wholesaler pockets. Winery prices haven't kept up with inflation since 2009. Meanwhile, wholesaler service fees have skyrocketed. The spread peaked in March 2025.

Translation: Consumers pay more. You make less. Distributors capture the difference.

But sure, keep chasing that Whole Foods placement for your ego. Keep begging sommeliers to pour your wine by the glass so you can tell your country club friends. Meanwhile, you're either making pennies on those bottles or actually *losing money* after buybacks, samples, and "marketing support" fees.

"But Russell, we need the exposure!"

No, you need revenue. That grocery store placement isn't driving people to your tasting room. It's subsidizing Southern Glazer's yacht collection while you struggle to make payroll. RNDC just exited California entirely. They saw the writing on the wall. When will you?

Your wine in a grocery store is a vanity metric. Your DTC revenue is a survival metric.

### **Problem #2: You're Land Rich, Cash Poor, and Technologically Bankrupt**

The average winery operates like it's 1995: tons of assets tied up in land, barely enough cash to make payroll, and a deep suspicion of anything that requires a password.

I get it. You'd rather spend $50K on new French oak than a CRM. The barrels are tangible. You can smell them. But here's what that CRM would do: turn your low 3% East Coast club conversion into 15%. Track every guest from first pour to lifetime value. Automate follow-ups that generate 32X better response rates than your quarterly newsletter.

"But Russell, we can't afford developers!"

Mama, you don't need them anymore. I built our entire review management system using ChatGPT prompts. Created a spin-to-win data capture app with Claude. Automated our wedding lead pipeline with some creative Zapier flows and a Google Sheet. Total development cost: $0. Time invested: a weekend.

LLMs have democratized software development. While you're hand-writing tasting notes, your competition is building AI-powered nurture sequences. The same tools that let a music major build production-ready apps can transform your operation. But you have to actually use them.

Your competition isn't other wineries. It's every beverage brand that figured out digital commerce while you were arguing about malolactic fermentation or what circa 1995 Mondavi-esque lifestyle marketing shoot you were going to do next.

### **Problem #3: The East Coast Bar Problem (And Why the West Coast Isn't Much Better)**

East Coast wineries, we need to talk. You're converting at 3% to club because you're running a bar that happens to make wine. Your staff is trained in hospitality, not sales. They're comfortable suggesting food pairings but allergic to asking for the wine club signup. You celebrate slightly higher bottle conversion because people are drinking at your venue like it's a restaurant.

Congrats. You've built an expensive bar with a vineyard view.

West Coast, don't get cocky. Your 6% club conversion isn't a victory lap—it's barely passing. You think you're running sales floors, but you're really running *slightly better bars*. In SaaS, we'd be giving an SDR converting at 6% a very close look. But you're patting yourself on the back because it's double what your East Coast cousins manage.

You know what else is relatively free? Using a Plaude Pin or similar device to record your tasting room interactions (in one-party consent states), then having AI analyze them like we do with sales calls. Your West Coast friends think 6% conversion makes them sales floors? They're not even monitoring what's actually being said at the table.

Technology doesn't replace hospitality. It weaponizes it.

### **Problem #4: You're Too Cheap to Hire Proper RevOps Talent**

"We can't compete with tech salaries!"

No kidding. You're offering $65K for a "Marketing Manager" who also runs your wine club, manages social media, pours in the tasting room on weekends, and somehow finds time to "optimize our digital presence." Meanwhile, a RevOps Manager at a Series B SaaS company is pulling $140K to do one thing: drive predictable revenue growth.

Here's the thing: that RevOps person could take your 3% East Coast conversion to 10% in a year. Your 6% West Coast operation? They'd have you at 15% asking why you ever settled for less. I know because I did it. Through boring stuff like:

- Implementing speed-to-lead protocols (from 48 hours to 15 minutes)

- Building attribution models that actually tell you which channels drive club signups

- Creating statistical models (ENET → OLS) to identify which behaviors correlate with conversion

- Recording and analyzing sales interactions to coach specific techniques

- Automated nurture sequences based on behavioral triggers, not calendar quarters

Hire one senior RevOps person instead of three junior "marketers." Pay them properly. Watch what happens.

### **The Future Is Smaller, Smarter, and Direct**

The winners in the next decade won't be the ones with the most acres or the fanciest restaurants pouring their wines. They'll be the ones who understood what Oregon already knows: small and direct beats big and distributed.

Think about it:

- Average Oregon vineyard: 20 acres

- Focus: Premium Pinot at $40+

- Distribution: Largely DTC

- Result: Weathering the storm while California burns

The three-tier system is a wealth transfer mechanism from producers to middlemen. Every bottle you sell through distribution is a bottle that could have generated 3X the margin direct. Every restaurant placement is an ego stroke that costs you money.

Get smarter at smaller scales. Build deeper relationships with fewer customers. Own your data, own your customers, own your destiny.

### **The Clock Is Ticking**

In 2031, when the Boomer exodus peaks, there will be two types of wineries:

1. Those that built modern GTM engines, stayed small and nimble, and treated DTC like oxygen

1. Those still waiting for their distributor checks while arguing about whether email and SMS marketing is "too pushy"

The ultra-premium DTC survivors will be the ones who understood that a 3% conversion rate isn't "industry standard"—it's industry failure. The ones who realized that chasing grocery store placement is a vanity project. The ones who stopped hiring hospitality staff to do sales jobs and started hiring RevOps professionals who actually understand funnels.

You can keep talking about terroir and tradition while wholesalers extract every penny of value from your supply chain. Or you can accept that the romance of wine means nothing if you're losing money on every wholesale case.

The tools exist. The playbooks are proven. Your conversion rates are an embarrassment. Your wholesale strategy is a suicide pact.

Your choice. But choose fast. Because at 3% conversion and negative wholesale margins, you're not really choosing—you're just managing decline.
