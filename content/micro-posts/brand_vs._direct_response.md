Brand vs. direct response isnâ€™t either/or. Itâ€™s both/and.

When marketing weddings, I never led with price. Instead, we sent a Lookbook first: emotional, romantic, aspirational.

Only after building the dream did we follow with the Package Guide.

Lead with brand emotion â†’ justify premium pricing later.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you lead with brand or direct response?
