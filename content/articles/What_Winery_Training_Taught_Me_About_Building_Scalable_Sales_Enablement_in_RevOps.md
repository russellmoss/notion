# What Winery Training Taught Me About Building Scalable Sales Enablement in RevOps

When people picture a winery tasting room, they think of hospitality — smiles, storytelling, great wine. What they don’t see is the sales floor behind it all.

At Milea Estate, we had a small but mighty team. Associates were warm, personable, and masters of the “platinum rule of hospitality” — giving guests the experience *they* wanted. But the reality was that our tasting room wasn’t hitting industry benchmarks in the one area that drives most of direct-to-consumer revenue: wine club conversions.

It wasn’t a wine quality issue — our wines were scoring in the 90s with Wine Enthusiast and James Suckling. The issue was enablement. Associates were inconsistent, some didn’t pitch the clubs at all, and with seasonal turnover, training was always behind. We needed to transform a group of hospitality professionals into sales professionals — without breaking their spirit of service.

### **Building the Training System**

I chose **Thinkific** as the platform — inexpensive, easy to use, and just good enough to house a comprehensive curriculum. Then I leaned on **AI tools** to accelerate development:

- Claude → structured modules, drafted content, generated field book + pledges

- GPT → HTML/CSS styling for sleek, digestible content

- **Gamma.app** → rapid slide generation

- My own edits → human-in-the-loop to ensure accuracy and relevance

This workflow compressed what could’ve taken months into about a week.

The result was an **8-hour training course** covering the full guest journey: greeting, storytelling, wine service, club pitches, follow-up. Each module was microlearning-driven — no unit longer than five minutes, no module longer than 1.5 hours — using a **watch, read, write, do** cycle to hit every learning style.

And we didn’t stop at knowledge. Associates made **weekly pledges**: concrete actions to improve, which they reflected on the following week. This turned training from passive to active.

### **The Results**

It’s tough to isolate one factor, since we also rolled out KPI dashboards and text-based micro-trainings at the same time. But collectively, these innovations produced a **71% increase in wine club conversion**. We leapt from East Coast averages (3.5%) to West Coast benchmarks (~6%).

Associates who leaned in loved the pledge system — it gave them agency and tied personal growth to commissions. Even the less-engaged employees were gradually pulled along by the culture of accountability and reflection.

### **The RevOps Lesson**

This wasn’t just winery training. It was **sales enablement at scale**:

- A structured, evergreen playbook = no “key man” risk

- Scalable onboarding = consistent messaging regardless of turnover

- AI-assisted course creation = speed without sacrificing quality

- Microlearning + pledges = behavior change, not just information dump

For managers already wearing too many hats, this system freed them up to coach strategically rather than re-explain the basics over and over.

In RevOps terms, this is exactly what enablement should do: remove bottlenecks, standardize execution, and make growth *repeatable*.

### **Key Takeaways for RevOps Leaders**

1. **Leverage AI for speed**, but keep a human-in-the-loop to maintain accuracy and nuance.

1. **Build scalable onboarding** so managers can focus on strategy, not constant re-training.

1. **Tie learning to behavior**, not just knowledge — pledges, reflections, and accountability loops make training stick.

We turned a hospitality-first tasting room into a consistent revenue engine. The tools were simple, the principles were not: enablement, automation, and scalable processes.

That’s RevOps — whether you’re selling wine clubs or SaaS subscriptions.
