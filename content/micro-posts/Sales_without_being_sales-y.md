How do you sell without feeling “sales-y”?

For me, it comes down to 3 steps:

Make a friend — build genuine connection.

Ask questions — uncover their needs.

Solve their problems — invite them into your solution.

People can smell authenticity. If you don’t believe in what you sell, they’ll know. But if you lead with empathy and conviction, sales feels like service.

👉 Agree or disagree?
