Objection #1 in weddings: PRICE.

How we handled it:

✅ Showed value-adds (what we include that others don’t)

✅ Exposed hidden costs at competitors (we don’t play that game)

✅ Focused email nurture on education (e.g., “5 Questions You Should Ask Any Venue — Even Us”)

Transparency builds trust. Trust justifies premium pricing.

👉 How do you handle the price objection in your world?
