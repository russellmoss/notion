Your KPIs are only as good as your data quality. And your data quality is only as good as your people actually inputting it, just ask

**Liz Mercer, MPS - Food Business**

, wine industry extraordinaireðŸ˜Š

At the winery, we rely on tasting room staff to input guest counts for every order. This single data point drives our conversion rate calculations, capacity planning, and associate performance metrics. Miss it, and your entire RevOps dashboard becomes fiction.

The Problem: Staff would forget to input guest counts ~15% of the time. That meant our conversion metrics were wrong, our forecasting was off, and our associate rankings were meaningless. Classic garbage-in, garbage-out.

The Solution:

Built an automated monitoring python script that:

âœ… Checks every order in real-time via Commerce7 API (thank you

**Andrew Kamphuis**

et al. for making such a builder friendly POS)

âœ… Identifies missing guest counts on tasting orders or orders that are clearly "in-person" (excludes club, e-comm and orders at events)

âœ… Sends immediate SMS/email alerts to managers

âœ… Prevents duplicate alerts using GitHub Actions cache

âœ… Runs every 15 minutes without human intervention

The Result: Data completion went from 85% â†’ 99%. Our conversion rate metrics are now trustworthy. Associate performance rankings are fair. Forecasting is accurate.

The Cost: a couple hours of my time and my free GitHub subscription

The RevOps Lesson: You can't manage what you can't measure. But you also can't measure what you don't capture.

The best RevOps teams don't just build dashboardsâ€”they build systems that ensure the data flowing into those dashboards is complete and reliable.

Whether you're tracking demo attendance, lead sources, or sales activity, ask yourself: What happens when your team forgets to log the critical data point? How do you know when it's missing? How do you fix it in real-time?

Data quality isn't a one-time setup. It's an ongoing operational discipline.

ðŸ‘‰ What's your team's "guest count problem"? The one missing field that makes all your metrics questionable?
