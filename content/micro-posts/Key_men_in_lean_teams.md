Managing lean teams means dealing with constant key man risk. Iâ€™ve learned two survival tactics:

âœ… Document everything â†’ SOPs prevent panic

âœ… Automate onboarding â†’ so turnover doesnâ€™t derail you

Ops is about resilience. If one person leaves and the system collapses, it wasnâ€™t leadership â€” it was luck.
