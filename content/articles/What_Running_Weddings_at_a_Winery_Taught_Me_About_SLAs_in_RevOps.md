# What Running Weddings at a Winery Taught Me About SLAs in RevOps

At first glance, running a small winery and running a SaaS go-to-market org don’t look alike. But when we launched weddings at Milea Estate, I found myself solving the same problems every RevOps leader eventually faces:

- How do you respond to leads fast enough?

- How do you respect your team’s time while meeting SLAs?

- How do you automate without losing the personal touch?

### **The Challenge: One Person, Many Hats**

Unlike larger venues with a full event sales team, our winery had a single “small but mighty” events manager. They handled everything: inquiries, tours, proposals, and event execution.

When we started selling weddings, I wanted to set clear expectations around **speed-to-lead**. So I wrote a Google Script to track how long it took from inquiry to reply. I set an SLA of **1 hour during business hours and 12 hours after hours**.

The result? A flood of alerts. The data showed what I already suspected: our event manager was overloaded. I didn’t want them burning out or feeling chained to their phone on weekends just to meet a target.

### **The First Lesson: Data Shows the Human Reality**

Collecting the data didn’t just measure performance — it highlighted a systemic issue: our SLA wasn’t realistic for one person. That’s a RevOps principle in disguise: **if your SLA requires heroics, it isn’t sustainable.**

---

### **The Solution: Automate the First Touch, Humanize the Follow-Up**

To fix this, I built an automation:

- Every new CRM lead triggered a **personalized text message** from a local number.

- The message referenced the action they took (“I noticed you downloaded our brochure…”) and signed off with the event manager’s name.

- It offered to send our package guide and set up a call.

The text didn’t replace the event manager — it bought them time, set expectations, and warmed the lead.

The impact? We estimate engagement rose by **~75%**. Text is simply more intimate and higher-response than email. More importantly, leads were primed for the sales call that would follow within 24 hours.

### **The Broader Lesson: SLAs Are Culture, Not Just Metrics**

That experiment taught me one of the most powerful lessons I’ve carried into RevOps:

- SLAs should serve both the **customer** (fast, clear follow-up) and the **team** (realistic workloads, no burnout).

- Automations aren’t just efficiency hacks, they’re cultural safeguards. They keep promises to leads *without breaking people*.

- When you fix both, you don’t just improve numbers, you build trust on both sides of the funnel.

At Milea, this and other innovations helped us **triple our conversion rates** and finally hit industry benchmarks. More importantly, we built a system where our events team could focus on what mattered: turning dream weddings into reality.

### **Why This Matters for RevOps**

RevOps isn’t about dashboards or acronyms. It’s about building operating systems that balance **growth, people, and process**.

Whether you’re selling SaaS or weddings, the principle is the same:

- Define clear SLAs.

- Measure the gap honestly.

- Automate where you can.

- Respect the humans doing the work.

That’s how you scale sustainably.
