Controversial take from running a winery:

Sometimes you have to fire customers.

Had a guest who got his refund but kept calling, abusing my team. I called his bank myself (they confirmed the refund). Then told him: stop harassing my employees or we're done.

Your team's mental health > one toxic customer's money.

Leadership isn't just hitting numbers. It's protecting your people.

ðŸ‘‰ Ever had to choose your team over revenue?
