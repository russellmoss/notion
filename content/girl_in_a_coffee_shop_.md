Write a post that starts with “

made eye contact with a girl in the coffee shop today

for those 1.47 seconds we locked eyes, i couldn’t help but think…”



This starts the preview of the post off strong and then turn it into something about RevOps. It’s not about dating or love it’s about how locking eyes with someone made you realize something about RevOps.
