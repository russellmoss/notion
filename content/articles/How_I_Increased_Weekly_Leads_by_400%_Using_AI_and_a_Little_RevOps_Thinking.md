# How I Increased Weekly Leads by 400% Using AI and a Little RevOps Thinking

We were running ads for our winery’s wedding venue on Google, Meta, and Pinterest. The click-through rates were strong — sometimes 25%. But there was a problem: despite hundreds of unique clicks each month, we were only seeing about 7 actual inquiries per week.

Something wasn’t adding up.

We didn’t have a dev team. We didn’t have budget to hire an agency. But what we *did* have were LLMs (GPT and Claude) — and a RevOps mindset.

Here’s what I discovered, and how we fixed it.

---

### **The Problems (and They’ll Sound Familiar to Any GTM Org)**

1. **We gave away value with no data capture.** Our wedding brochure was just a free download. Anyone could grab it without leaving a name or email. No way to follow up, no way to retarget.

1. **Our inquiry form was trapped in a weak CRM.** We used Perfect Venue, which is fantastic for banquet event orders, but its CRM was barebones. No pipeline visibility, no speed-to-lead tracking, no conversion reporting.

1. **There was no clear path to “book a call.”** If someone wanted to talk to sales, they had to email “events@...” or call the front desk. Too much friction.

Sound familiar? These are the same funnel gaps SaaS companies run into all the time.

### **The Fix (Without Paying a Developer)**

I copied our WordPress HTML into Claude and asked it to generate the changes I needed. In about a week, here’s what we stood up:

- **Brochure Download Modal** → captured name, wedding details, SMS/email opt-in. Auto-sent brochure in the first email.

- **Custom Inquiry Form** → hosted on a Kinsta subdomain, tied directly into a home-built CRM that tracked SLAs and funnel velocity.

- **Consultation Call Modal** → captured lead data and pushed directly to a Calendly booking, feeding the CRM at the same time.

- **Facebook Lead Forms Integration** → leads fed directly into the CRM with notifications to sales.

Every touchpoint now generated structured data, triggered an automation, and created accountability.

---

### **The Results**

- Leads jumped from **7 per week → 36 per week**.

- Capture rate rose from a small fraction of CTRs to about **67% of unique click-throughs**.

- Lead distribution diversified:

Before, 70% of our leads came from a single clunky website form. Now, we had multiple high-performing entry points.

### **The RevOps Lesson**

This wasn’t about weddings. It was about **thinking like a RevOps operator**:

- **Stop leakage.** Don’t let high CTRs die at the landing page. Always exchange value for data.

- **Fix the tech stack.** A weak CRM or disconnected form is a silent pipeline killer.

- **Reduce friction.** “Book a call” shouldn’t take detective work.

And here’s the kicker: we didn’t need a developer or a six-figure martech budget. With GPT and Claude, we closed the gap ourselves.

### **Takeaway**

Most organizations — from wineries to SaaS startups — don’t need “more leads.” They need to **capture and convert the demand they already have.**

For us, that meant going from 7 → 36 leads per week with the exact same ad spend. For you, it might mean tightening your funnel hand-offs, automating follow-up, or creating a better self-serve path to sales.

That’s RevOps: seeing the gap, fixing the system, and making growth repeatable.

👉 Curious — have you ever found that the biggest lever wasn’t generating more demand, but fixing the capture and conversion mechanics you already had?
