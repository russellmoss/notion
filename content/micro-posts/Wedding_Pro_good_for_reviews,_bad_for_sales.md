WeddingPro (The Knot, Wedding Wire) shocked me. I assumed it would be a top channel. Lots of leads came in â€” but they were low quality: price shoppers, not ideal-fit clients. Conversions were poor. Still, itâ€™s valuableâ€¦ for reviews. Couples check it for social proof. We just donâ€™t expect it to drive revenue.ðŸ‘‰ Whatâ€™s a marketing channel that surprised you â€” either in success or failure?
