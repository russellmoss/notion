## How I Built a Spin-to-Win App That Boosted Tasting Room Revenue 25% (And You Can Too)

**25% increase in average order value. 40% improvement in data capture. Associate performance tracking that actually works.**

These aren't hypothetical projections. These are the real results from a gamified giveaway app I built for the tasting room – without a development team, without a six-figure budget, and without years of coding experience.

If you read my post about "Vibe Coding" last week, you know I believe domain experts are the future of software development. Today, I'm pulling back the curtain on exactly how I built this revenue-generating app using AI-first development, and why your tasting room (or retail space, or showroom) needs one yesterday.

### **The Problem That Sparked a Solution**

Every tasting room manager knows the dance: You want guest information for marketing, but nobody wants to fill out another form. You need to track associate performance, but manual logging is a joke. You want to drive higher purchases, but discounting erodes margins.

I needed a solution that would:

- Capture customer data without friction

- Incentivize larger purchases strategically

- Track which associates drive engagement

- Integrate seamlessly with our existing tech stack

- Actually be fun for guests

Vendors quoted me $15-30K and 3-6 months. I built it myself in a weekend.

### **The Vibe Coding Build Process in Action**

### **Day 1: The Architecture Conversation**

I opened Claude and typed:

*"I need a tasting room giveaway app where guests enter contact info, spin a weighted prize wheel (lower-value prizes win more often), integrates with Commerce7 CRM and Klaviyo email marketing, tracks which employee referred them, and prevents duplicate entries. What's the simplest stack?"*

Claude suggested Node.js/Express backend with vanilla JavaScript frontend. Simple. Proven. Deployable anywhere.

### **Day 2: The Technical Blueprint**

The app architecture ended up beautifully simple:

**Frontend Flow:**

1. Landing page with giveaway intro

1. Contact form (first name, last name, email, phone)

1. Optional social media engagement step

1. Interactive spinning wheel with weighted probabilities

1. Automatic redirect to wine club page

**Backend Magic:**

- Express server handling two critical endpoints

- /submit creates/updates Commerce7 customer profiles

- /prize assigns prizes and applies customer tags

- Environment variables keeping API keys secure

- CORS configuration for web integration

### **Day 3-4: The Integration Dance**

Here's where domain expertise beats pure dev skills every time. I knew exactly how Commerce7's customer data model worked. I understood Klaviyo's flow triggers. Most importantly, I knew what would actually drive revenue.

Every participant gets tagged with their prize and the associate who referred them. This feeds directly into Klaviyo segments and Commerce7 reporting.

**The Klaviyo Flow:**

1. Customer enters the system with 'giveaway_participant' tag

1. Triggers welcome flow with prize redemption instructions

1. Prize email includes redemption code and expiration date

1. Follow-up sequence based on prize type and redemption status

1. Associates get credit in our internal dashboards

### **The Strategic Prize Weighting That Drives Revenue**

This is where understanding your business beats any algorithm. Our prize weights aren't random – they're revenue optimizers:

- **5% off 4+ bottles** (33% probability) – Drives immediate wine sales

- **10% off 4+ bottles** (25% probability) – Higher discount, still profitable

- **5% off merchandise** (17% probability) – Moves non-wine inventory

- **25% off a case** (10% probability) – Converts to club members

- **Free tasting flights** (13% + 5%) – Guarantees return visits

- **Private dinner for two** (0.02%) – The "grand prize" that creates buzz

Every prize is designed to either increase today's transaction or guarantee a future visit. There are no "free t-shirt" consolation prizes. Every spin drives revenue.

### **The Privacy and Compliance Layer**

Before anyone jumps in with "but what about opt-in requirements?" – we've got you covered. The app includes:

- Clear opt-in language on the initial form

- Checkbox confirmation for marketing communications

- GDPR-compliant data handling (yes, we get EU tourists)

- Duplicate prevention via email validation

- Secure API key management (never exposed client-side)

The legal disclaimer is right there: "By participating, you agree to receive marketing communications about your prize and special offers from Milea Estate Vineyard."

### **The Results That Matter**

**Quantifiable Wins:**

- 25% increase in average order value for participants

- 40% boost in email capture rate (from 35% to 75% of guests)

- 500+ new marketing-qualified leads per month

- Associate performance tracking that actually drives behavior

**Hidden Benefits:**

- Guests LOVE it – they're literally playing a game

- Associates push it because they get credit (and compete)

- The data flows automatically into our CRM and email platform

- Prize redemptions drive return visits within 30 days

### **Why This Changes Everything**

Five years ago, building this would have required:

- A development team (3-6 people)

- A project manager

- 3-6 months timeline

- $30-50K budget minimum

- Ongoing maintenance contracts

Today, with AI-first development, I built it in a weekend for the cost of hosting (~$20/month on Kinsta).

But here's the real revelation: **I could build this BECAUSE I understand the tasting room.** I know that a 25% case discount converts fence-sitters into wine club members. I know that tracking associate performance drives friendly competition. I know that "spin to win" taps into the same psychology that makes people love slot machines.

A traditional developer would have built a technically perfect app that missed these nuances. A domain expert with AI tools builds something that actually drives revenue.

### **Your Playbook to Build This Tomorrow**

**The Tech Stack (Copy This):**

- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (keep it simple)

- Backend: Node.js + Express

- Database: Your CRM is your database (Commerce7, Salesforce, etc.)

- Deployment: Kinsta, Vercel, or any Node hosting

- Integrations: Your CRM + email platform APIs

**The Prompts That Built This:**

*Architecture:* "Create a giveaway web app with contact form, weighted prize wheel, [YOUR CRM] integration, duplicate prevention, employee tracking via URL parameters"

*Implementation:* "Generate complete Express server with /submit and /prize endpoints, environment variables for API keys, CORS support, error handling"

*Frontend:* "Build responsive prize wheel using JavaScript, localStorage for session management, smooth animations, mobile-optimized"

**The Business Logic You Need:**

1. Weight low-value, high-margin prizes heavily

1. Make every prize drive either immediate revenue or return visits

1. Track everything through your CRM tags

1. Set prize expiration dates (30 days creates urgency)

1. Let associates compete on participation rates

### **The Bottom Line**

We're entering an era where the best software will be built by the people who actually do the work. Not because they're better programmers, but because they understand the problem space intimately.

This giveaway app works because I've stood in that tasting room. I've watched guests hesitate at the email signup. I've seen associates forget to log their pour counts. I've calculated the lifetime value of a wine club member.

That domain expertise, combined with AI-first development, is unstoppable.

**So here's my challenge:** What's the one manual process in your business that drives you crazy? The thing vendors won't prioritize? The workflow that only you truly understand?

That's your first build. This weekend. Using the Vibe Coding workflow.

Drop a comment with what you're going to build. Include your industry and the problem you're solving. I'll personally help architect the first 10 responses.

Time to stop buying software and start building it.
