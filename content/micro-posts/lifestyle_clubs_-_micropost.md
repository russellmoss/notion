**100,000 tons of grapes rotting on California vines. Every. Single. Year.**

That's not a typo. While East Coast wineries are treating their tasting rooms like bars with a vineyard view, California is literally watching their industry decompose. 30,000 acres getting ripped out annually. The Boomer Cliff isn't coming, it's here.

Here's the uncomfortable truth nobody wants to say out loud: Gen Y drinks way less than their parents. Gen Z? They drink even less than Millennials. Now they're sipping "natural" garage wines that taste like kombucha had a bad day, and we're shocked they won't join our rigid 12-bottle quarterly wine clubs.

But here's the thing - they still want to belong to something. Just look at SoHo House. Packed with wealthy Millennials paying $3,200/year to see and be seen. They're not anti-club. They're anti-boring-wine-club.

The fix? Stop selling wine, start selling lifestyle.

At the winery, we're already getting requests for co-working spaces. Think about that. People want to work from wineries, not just drink at them. Monthly memberships with credits for pickle ball, spa treatments, stays, tastings. Same predictable revenue as traditional clubs. Completely different value proposition.

East Coast wineries averaging 3% club conversion? That's pitiful. You know what gets you 6%? Literally just asking every single table to join. Not even being good at sales. Just. Asking. Every. Table.

This demographic hurricane is still a few days from shore. You can transition slowly from tasting room to country club model over the next 3-5 years. Add amenities gradually. Test membership tiers. Build community features. OR you can stick with business as usual and get absolutely demolished when it makes landfall.

The wholesale channel is dead man walking. Small premium DTC brands running tasting rooms as "sales couched in hospitality" will survive. Everyone else? Start learning pickle ball rules.

ðŸ‘‰ What would your winery look like if it was a country club that happened to make wine instead of a winery that happened to have a tasting room? ;)
