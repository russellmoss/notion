AGI is coming and you're worried about the wrong thing.

When everyone has infinite intelligence in their pocket, what's your edge? It's not what you know anymore. It's who you are.

Perfect proposals? AI does that. Flawless presentations? Done in seconds. Strategic frameworks? Downloaded instantly.

What's left is the vibe.

At my winery, I watched this play out daily. The sommelier with encyclopedic wine knowledge but zero personality? Sold nothing. The guy who called Gew√ºrztraminer "that German one" but made every guest feel like family? Wine club conversions through the roof.

When intelligence becomes a commodity, character becomes currency.

The future belongs to people who can:

- Read a room without a dashboard

- Make someone laugh after their worst day

- Know when to shut up and pour another glass

- Build trust through presence, not PowerPoints

We're entering the Vibes Economy. Your technical skills will be tablestakes. Your humanity will be your moat.

Are you building your technical expertise or your ability to connect? Because only one of those remains scarce when AGI arrives.
