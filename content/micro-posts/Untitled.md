Small automation, big impact: SMS outreach.  Our events manager used to manually respond to every inquiry. Texting all leads wasnâ€™t realistic. But with automation, every new lead got a personalized text instantly.

The lift:

âœ… Faster first touch

âœ… Higher engagement (text beats email for Gen Z, Millennials, even Gen X)

âœ… Freed up manager time for later-funnel nurturing

ðŸ‘‰ Whatâ€™s the smallest automation youâ€™ve built that had the biggest impact?
