We thought we needed more wedding leads. The truth? We weren’t capturing the demand we already had.

CTR: 200–250 people hitting our wedding page each month.

Actual inquiries: ~30.

The fix:

- Put a brochure download behind a form (data capture)

- Bypassed a weak CRM (Perfect Venue) with our own CRM + automation

- Added a “Book a Call” button

Result: 400%+ more captured leads.

👉 Often the problem isn’t lead gen, it’s lead capture. Where is your funnel leaking?
