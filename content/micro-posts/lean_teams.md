Running lean teams is hard. You face “key person risk” every day. The lessons I’ve learned:Document everything (SOPs are your safety net) Automate onboarding so you’re not reliant on one person training And most importantly — create a home.It’s easy to obsess over KPIs and forget to ask, “How was your day?” Recognition and soft touches reduce churn just as much as comp plans.👉 For leaders: when’s the last time you took someone on your team to lunch just to celebrate them?
