Everyone tracked bottle conversion.
We ran statistical analysis (ENET → OLS → KPI Index).

Truth: Wine club conversion drives 90% of attributable revenue.

Bottle conversion? Inflated by on-premise consumption. Not tracked properly. Wrong focus.

Measure what moves money, not what looks good in reports.
