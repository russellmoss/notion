# The California Flu Is Coming: Why American Wineries Need to Build Lifestyle Clubs or Die

**100,000 tons of grapes are rotting on California vines every year. The Boomer Cliff is here. And if you think your traditional wine club will save you, I've got 30,000 acres of ripped-out vines to sell you.**

Three years into running a Hudson Valley winery, I've watched the data go from concerning to catastrophic. Wine volumes fell 4% in 2023, another 5.3% in 2024. IWSR expects a ~-1% CAGR decline in US wine through 2028, but that's the optimistic view. The reality? We're staring down the barrel of a demographic apocalypse that makes climate change look like a minor inconvenience.

Last week, a colleague in Napa told me they're paying crews to leave fruit on the vines because it's cheaper than harvesting grapes nobody wants. This is the same region where land goes for $300,000 an acre. If California is sneezing, the rest of us are about to catch pneumonia.

## **The Numbers Are Brutal (And Getting Worse)**

Let's talk data, because feelings won't pay your mortgage:

- All Boomers are 65+ by 2030; mortality and aging-out effects accelerate in the late 2020s and 2030s

- SVB explicitly estimates the Boomer-driven sales decline peaks ~2029–2031

- We're already in a category recession (multi-year volume and, in 2024, value declines)

- Base case scenario: ~90–93 by 2030 and ~85–90 by 2035 (i.e., 10–15% lower demand by 2030; ~10–15% further downside risk into the early/mid-2030s unless offset by recruiting new drinkers or trading up)

Translation: We're looking at 15-20% demand destruction this decade. And that's if everything goes well.

The California crisis isn't just oversupply. It's a canary in a coal mine filled with generational methane. When regions that defined American wine culture for 50 years are ripping out vines at industrial scale, you don't get to pretend your 500-case production in Virginia is immune.

## **We Abandoned An Entire Generation (And Now They're Abandoning Us)**

Here's where I get controversial: The wine industry's obsession with prestige and tradition created this mess.

While we were debating malolactic fermentation and arguing about cork vs screwcap, an entire generation discovered they could get buzzed on hard seltzers that don't require a sommelier certification to understand. We built tasting rooms that feel like libraries and wonder why 25-year-olds prefer breweries.

The few Millennials and Gen Z consumers who DO drink wine? They're buying natural wines from Instagram sommeliers. Wines that, frankly, often taste like they were made in someone's bathtub. But you know what those wines have that ours don't? A story that resonates. A community that feels inclusive. A purchase process that doesn't involve committing to 12 bottles of Chardonnay every quarter.

Millennials and some younger LDA consumers are engaging—especially with better stories, formats, and value—but they buy differently and less frequently than heavy Boomer cohorts. Different doesn't mean wrong. Different means opportunity, if we're smart enough to see it.

## **The Lifestyle Club Solution: Stop Selling Wine, Start Selling Belonging**

At Milea Estate, we're already getting asked about co-working spaces. Let that sink in. People who moved to the Hudson Valley during COVID want to work from our winery. Not visit occasionally. Work. Daily.

This isn't about wine. It's about community, lifestyle, and creating spaces where people want to exist. So here's the model we're developing:

### **The Modern Winery Membership Model:**

**Structure:**

- $150-300/month membership (not wine club)

- Credits system: members load accounts monthly, spend across ecosystem

- Tiered benefits based on membership level

**What Members Get:**

- Co-working space access with WiFi, coffee, quiet zones

- Discounted/free tastings for them and guests

- Event access: yoga in the vines, harvest dinners, winemaker sessions

- Recreation: pickle ball courts, bocce, hiking trail access

- Hospitality perks: discounts on accommodation, spa treatments (if applicable)

- Wine benefits: member pricing, exclusive releases, first access

- Community: member-only Slack/Discord, networking events

**Why This Works:**

- Predictable monthly revenue (better than quarterly wine shipments)

- Lower barrier to entry ($150/month vs $300+ quarterly)

- Multiple touchpoints = deeper relationships

- Appeals to experience economy

- Creates community stickiness beyond product

**The Data Behind It:**
We surveyed 500 visitors last quarter. 67% of Millennials said they'd join a "lifestyle membership" at a winery. Only 12% wanted a traditional wine club. The math isn't hard.

## **For The "But We Make Fine Wine" Crowd**

I hear you already: "This cheapens the brand." "We're about quality, not pickle ball." "Our wines speak for themselves."

Cool. How's that working for you?

Because here's what I learned running a winery that went from 40 members to 1,600 in three years: Your 95-point wine doesn't matter if nobody's buying it. Your pristine brand doesn't matter if you can't make payroll. Your tradition doesn't matter if your customer base is literally dying.

Treat 2025–2028 as a grind: low single-digit declines likely. After that? Expect a sharper demographic downdraft ~2029–2031 as heavy Boomer buyers age out; plan for another ~5–10% demand risk layered on the base glide path if unaddressed.

This isn't about abandoning quality. Make great wine. Charge premium prices for it. But recognize that wine is becoming a smaller part of what wineries need to offer to survive.

## **The GTM Mindset: Hospitality First, Sales Always**

Even if you're not ready for pickle ball courts, here's what every winery needs to do NOW:

### **1. Run Your Tasting Room Like a Sales Floor**

- Track conversion rates religiously (wine club, bottle, total)

- Implement speed-to-lead systems (follow up within 2 hours, not 2 days)

- Build attribution models connecting staff to revenue

- Create KPI dashboards visible to everyone

### **2. Embrace Technology (It Won't Bite)**

- CRM isn't optional anymore. Commerce7, Wine Direct, whatever, just pick one

- Automate follow-ups: abandoned cart emails, visit thank yous, club nudges

- Build SMS campaigns (they outperform email 3:1)

- Use AI for content creation, customer service, data analysis

### **3. Diversify Revenue Streams**

- Sparkling & celebratory occasions; $15–$25 "value-premium" where NIQ sees relative resilience

- Formats that reduce commitment (half bottles, cans), and moderation-friendly options (no/low, lower ABV)

- RTD collaborations, wine slushies, whatever sells

- Events, experiences, education, anything that brings people in

### **4. Fix Your Messaging**

- Stop talking about terroir. Start talking about moments

- Make wine approachable, not intimidating

- Clear ABV, sugar, and calorie disclosures; position wine with food/occasion rather than daily habit

- Tell stories about people, not soil pH

## **The Bottom Line: Adapt or Die**

SVB (Rob McMillan, 2025): Structural demand reset; Boomer effect peaks 2029–2031; premium can claw back to flat before then; grape oversupply and pricing pressure likely; wineries need active demand generation.

Active demand generation. Not passive hope. Not waiting for wine culture to magically return. Active.

The California flu is real. 100,000 tons of rotting grapes real. 30,000 acres of ripped vines real. And it's spreading east faster than spotted lanternfly.

But here's the thing, and maybe this is the optimist in me talking (or maybe it's just the pragmatist who's seen revenue 4X in three years): This crisis is also opportunity. The wineries that survive will be stronger, smarter, more connected to their communities. They'll offer more than wine, they'll offer belonging. They'll run operations with the precision of tech companies and the warmth of family businesses.

They'll build lifestyle clubs that happen to include wine, not wine clubs that happen to include lifestyle.

The question isn't whether the wine industry will transform. It's whether your winery will be part of the transformation or a casualty of it. The Boomers are aging out whether we're ready or not. California's already feeling it. The rest of us have maybe 3-5 years to figure this out.

So... you building that pickle ball court yet? Or are you waiting for 100,000 tons of your own grapes to rot first?
