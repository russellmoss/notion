Early on as a GM, I made the mistake of asking employees to answer emails and calls on their days off.

It didn’t work. They weren’t responding anyway — and it just created resentment.

The reality: employees aren’t “owners.” Without equity, they shouldn’t be treated like they are.

The solution: automation. With Zapier, Klaviyo, our CRM, and SimpleTexting, we automated responses so employees could actually take time off without hurting the business.

👉 Leaders: how do you balance respecting time off while still hitting targets?
