GOOD sales is coachable: MEDDICC, SPIN, Solution Selling.

GREAT sales is like terroir in wineâ€”it's the confluence of someone's entire life experience.

Great sellers genuinely care about others MORE than commission. They have "hospitality heart."

Hire for hunger and empathy. Train for technique.

ðŸ‘‰ Best salesperson you knowâ€”learned or born?
