Not all KPIs are good KPIs.Iâ€™ve seen teams obsess over absolute values:âœ… $X revenue per monthâœ…Y number of wine club signupsThe flaw? It ignores efficiency. If you sign 10 wine club members with 100 visitors, then again 10 with 200 visitors, somethingâ€™s broken.Better: track rates and ratios. Layer statistical models (ENET, OLS) to build a KPI index that actually reflects performance.ðŸ‘‰ Whatâ€™s a KPI youâ€™ve killed because it drove the wrong behavior?
