A few years ago, **Kaan Kurtural** delivered a prophetic warning: "When California gets a cold, the rest of the wine industry gets the flu."

The cold had already started. We just didn't want to see it.

Today, California is crushing its lightest harvest in 20 years. Over 100,000 tons of grapes rotted on the vine in 2024—for the second consecutive year. The state's pulling 35,000-40,000 acres annually. This isn't a cold anymore. It's pneumonia.

Yet here's what's fascinating: Oregon's planted acreage remains "in balance with demand" according to Silicon Valley Bank's 2025 report. The state's production is flat, pricing stable. The flu never came.

This divergence reveals something profound about the next 30-50 years of American wine—and why, after building Milea Estate Vineyard into the Hudson Valley's premier winery, I'm pivoting to RevOps in fintech.

### **The Data Tells a Story We Should Have Seen Coming**

The numbers are brutal but honest:

- U.S. alcohol consumption: lowest in 90 years

- Boomers aging out: peak negative impact 2029-2031

- Millennials/Gen Z: choosing spirits, RTDs, cannabis over wine

- Distributor inventory: 1.6x sales (should be 1.3x)

- Average reserve tasting fee: $72 (up 200% since 2012)

California built its empire on volume—570,000 acres feeding a mass market through the three-tier system. When that market evaporated, the entire Central Valley became an albatross. Premium regions like Napa still command $91.84 per bottle DTC. But for every Napa, there's a thousand acres of bulk wine nobody wants.

Oregon? Different story. They never chased volume. Average vineyard: 20 acres. Focus: Pinot Noir at $40+. Distribution: largely DTC. When the mass market collapsed, they barely noticed.

### **The Next 30 Years: A Smaller, Smarter, More Direct Industry**

Looking forward, American wine will bifurcate completely:

**Winners:**

- DTC-focused wineries controlling their narrative

- Premium producers ($20+ bottles) with authentic stories

- East Coast regions capitalizing on proximity to 50M consumers

- Sustainable/organic certified operations (market triples by 2030)

**Casualties:**

- Sub-$12 wholesale-dependent brands

- Bulk grape growers without contracts

- Regions that can't adapt to climate change

- Anyone still marketing like it's 1995

The three-tier system is dying. RNDC just exited California entirely. Southern Glazer's controls half the market but can't move inventory. The future is direct relationships, digital engagement, and experiences that resonate with portfolio drinkers who see wine as one option among many.

### **Why RevOps? Because the Problems Are Universal**

At Milea, I built systems that 40X'd our wine club and 50X'd e-commerce revenue. Created AI-powered dashboards tracking conversion/latency/coverage. Automated speed-to-lead from hours to minutes. Used statistical modeling (ENET, OLS) to identify which KPIs actually moved revenue.

Sound familiar? It should. These are RevOps problems.

Whether you're optimizing grape yields or SaaS conversion rates, the approach is identical:

- Identify the bottlenecks

- Build systems that scale

- Measure what matters

- Coach to the data

- Iterate relentlessly

The wine industry taught me that sustainable growth comes from understanding your funnel, not just filling it. That lesson translates perfectly to fintech, where the stakes are higher but the principles unchanged.

### **The Uncomfortable Truth About Timing**

I could stay in wine. Weather this storm. Help wineries navigate the great reset. And I will—through consulting, board positions, and strategic advisory.

But the data is clear: we're entering a 5-10 year contraction. The creative destruction will be necessary and ultimately healthy. But it will be brutal for those living through it.

My move to RevOps isn't an abandonment—it's a strategic pivot based on the same analytical framework I've always used. The skills transfer. The problems rhyme. The opportunity to build and scale is greater.

### **For Those Staying in Wine: Your Playbook**

1. **Accept reality**: The Boomer party is over. Build for the new consumer.

1. **Go direct**: Own your customer relationship or become obsolete.

1. **Premium or perish**: The middle is disappearing. Pick a side.

1. **Embrace sustainability**: It's not optional anymore.

1. **Think experience**: You're not selling wine. You're selling belonging.

For California growers: if you're not contracted, not organic, and not in a premium AVA, the math doesn't work. I'm sorry. That's the truth.

For everyone else: this reset creates opportunity. Smaller players can be more agile. Regional identity matters more than ever. The consumers who remain will pay more for authenticity.

### **The View from Here**

Wine gave me everything. Taught me to read the land, understand systems, manage complexity, and find signal in noise. These lessons shaped how I approach every problem—from vineyard irrigation to revenue attribution.

Now I'm taking those lessons to fintech, where the feedback loops are faster but the thinking is the same. Data. Systems. People. Results.

To my wine colleagues: I'll still be around. Consulting on RevOps transformations. Building the tech stacks you need. Helping navigate the storm. Because whether it's grapes or SaaS, the fundamentals don't change—you need to know your numbers, own your customer, and build systems that scale.

The next 30 years of American wine will be defined by those who see this crisis not as an ending, but as a beginning. A chance to build something smaller, better, more connected to the people who drink it.

I'll be watching from the RevOps world, applying these same lessons to new problems. And occasionally, on weekends, you'll still find me in a vineyard. Because some things you never really leave.

They just become part of who you are.
