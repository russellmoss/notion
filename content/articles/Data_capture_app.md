# Your Winery Can't Tell You Its Data Capture Rate Right Now (Mine Tracks Every Single Guest)

Ask your tasting room manager this: "What percentage of today's guests gave us their contact info?"

I'll wait.

They're probably scrambling through Commerce7 reports, making educated guesses, or straight up admitting they have no idea. Because here's the truth nobody wants to admit... **the wine industry talks endlessly about data capture but NOBODY actually measures it in real-time.**

You measure bottle conversion. Club conversion. AOV. Revenue per guest. But the most important metric, the one that drives everything else? Total blank.

I just finished analyzing our email list growth vs revenue. The math is undeniable. 94% list growth = 70% revenue growth. Every email we capture is worth $9-10 in MONTHLY recurring revenue. When our list grows, revenue follows 67% of the time in the same month.

That's not correlation. That's your bank account begging you to capture more emails.

## The System Everyone Pretends They Have (But Don't)

Most wineries have what I call "data capture theater":

- Staff are "trained" to ask for emails

- There's a clipboard somewhere with a sign-up sheet

- The Spin-to-Win game gets 200 plays but nobody tracks who's playing

- Wedding inquiries get counted as "captured data" even though 80% ghost you

- Management sends weekly reminders to "remember to get emails!"

Meanwhile, you're flying blind. Is Sarah crushing it at 85% capture? Is Mike struggling at 20%? Is your fancy new data capture tool actually working?

You. Don't. Know.

So I built a system that tracks EVERYTHING. Every guest. Every method. Every associate. In real-time.

## The Dashboard That Changed Everything

**GitHub repo: ****https://github.com/russellmoss/winery-data-capture**

This isn't just another analytics dashboard. It's a complete data capture accountability system that does what Commerce7 and every other KPI tool refuses to do: actually measure your capture rate.

Here's what it tracks:

**Every Capture Method:**

- Spin-to-Win digital entries

- Physical sign-up sheets (yes, we still use paper and it works)

- POS entries at checkout

- Wedding inquiry forms

- Event registrations

- Wine club signups

**Every Metric That Matters:**

- Individual associate capture rates

- Company-wide performance

- Channel-specific rates (wedding vs tasting room vs events)

- Email subscription opt-in percentages

- Phone number capture rates

- Historical trends and comparisons

**Automated Intelligence:**

- AI-generated weekly reports with specific coaching recommendations

- Automated emails to managers with actionable insights

- CSV exports for deep-dive analysis

- Real-time performance tracking (no more month-old data)

## The Magic of Making It VISIBLE

Here's what happened when we made data capture rates visible to everyone:

**Week 1:** Associates discovered their actual capture rates. Shock and denial. "I always ask for emails!" Sure, Jennifer. Your 12% rate says otherwise.

**Week 2:** Competition kicked in. Sarah saw she was at 73%. Mike was at 31%. Suddenly Mike started asking Sarah for tips during lunch.

**Week 4:** We added commission bonuses for capture rates above 70%. Game changed overnight.

**Month 2:** Company-wide capture rate went from ~35% (our guess) to 67% (actually measured).

**Month 6:** Email list growth up 94%. Revenue up 70%. Direct correlation proven.

## The Part Nobody Talks About: Manual Entry Still Matters

Yeah, we use paper. Deal with it.

Sometimes the best data capture tool is a beautifully designed card on the table that says "Join our wine family" with spaces for name, email, and phone. Guests fill it out while they're waiting for their tasting. No friction. No "can you spell that email?" No tablets dying mid-shift.

But here's the innovation: when associates collect these cards, they enter them into our dashboard and get FULL CREDIT for that capture. The system tracks who captured what, when, and how. Paper capture counts just as much as digital. Because data is data, regardless of how you got it.

This solves the oldest problem in tasting room operations: associates who are great at connecting with guests but "forget" the admin work. Now they're incentivized to do both. Capture on paper, input later, get credit immediately.

## Why Commission-Based Capture Actually Works

We tried everything:

- Mandatory training (ignored)

- Daily reminders (tune out)

- Public shaming (toxic)

- Best practices workshops (dozed off)

Then we tried this: $1 per captured email above 70% capture rate.

Suddenly everyone cares. Not because they're greedy, but because it's FAIR. You capture more data, you earn more money. You help the company grow, you share in that growth. Sarah's making an extra $200/month because she captures 85% of her guests. Mike's learning her techniques because he wants that too.

The beauty? It's all tracked automatically. No manager discretion. No favoritism. No "I think Sarah's doing better." The dashboard shows exact numbers. Math doesn't lie.

## The AI That Turns Data Into Action

Every Monday, our managers get this email:

---

**Weekly Data Capture Intelligence Report**

*Executive Summary:*
Team captured 67% of guests this week, up from 64% last week. Sarah leads at 87%, while Mike improved from 31% to 45% after implementing new techniques.

*Key Wins:*

- Saturday's 78% capture rate proves staffing model works

- Paper forms outperformed digital 2:1 during rush periods

- New greeting script showing 15% improvement in capture

*Action Items:*

1. Have Mike shadow Sarah for one shift (87% vs 45% capture)

1. Order more paper forms for Saturday rushes

1. Consider reducing Spin-to-Win friction (3 fields to 2)

*Coaching Focus:*
Mike and Jennifer need support on initial engagement. They're great at service but miss the capture moment. Recommend 10-minute role-play before Saturday shift.

This isn't generic AI garbage. It's trained on OUR data, OUR patterns, OUR business. It knows that Saturday rushes need paper backup. It identifies exactly who needs help and what kind.

## The Wedding Data Problem (And Why We Can Exclude It)

Wedding inquiries are not created equal.

Someone filling out a wedding form might never set foot in your venue. They're shopping 10 places, ghosting 9. But someone standing in your tasting room, glass in hand, credit card out? That's a REAL prospect.

Our system lets you toggle wedding data on/off because sometimes you need to see pure tasting room performance without the noise. When we exclude wedding channels, our TRUE capture rate becomes clear. No inflation from inquiries that never convert.

## Your Move: Measure or Guess

The code is free. Open source. Every line documented. Clone it, customize it, deploy it today.

But most of you won't.

Because implementing this means admitting your current "system" is just hoping people remember to ask for emails. It means discovering your real capture rate is probably half what you think. It means accountability.

It also means 70% revenue growth when you fix it.

The wineries still guessing their capture rates will be crushed by the ones who measure. The ones celebrating 40% capture will lose to operations pushing 80%. The future belongs to those who measure everything and optimize relentlessly.

Your choice: Keep pretending your team "always gets emails" or actually know your numbers and fix them.

The dashboard is free. The insights are priceless. The only question is whether you're ready to see the truth.

*P.S. - Next week I'm sharing the automated nurture sequences that turn captured emails into $10/month recurring revenue. Seven emails, three SMS, one path to wine club glory.*

*P.P.S. - Shoutout to Commerce7 for the API that makes this possible, and to my team for actually entering the damn data once we started paying them for it.*
