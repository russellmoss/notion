Stopped ranking our wine sales team 1-10.
Started using standard deviation instead.

Why it works:

- Removes politics from performance

- Shows who's TRULY exceptional vs. normal variance

- Everyone understands the math

Someone at #8 might actually be performing normally. Someone at #3 might need help.

Math doesn't lie. Managers do.
